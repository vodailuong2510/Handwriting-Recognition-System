# Handwriting-Recognition-System
# Overview
This project focuses on building a handwriting recognition system using the MNIST dataset. MNIST is a widely used benchmark dataset containing 28x28 grayscale images of handwritten digits (0-9). The goal of this project is to develop a deep learning model that can accurately classify these handwritten digits.

# Dataset
The MNIST dataset consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images of handwritten digits. Each image is labeled with the corresponding digit it represents. The dataset is preprocessed and normalized to ensure consistent input for the model.

Model Architecture
The handwriting recognition model is built using TensorFlow, a popular deep learning framework. The architecture of the model typically consists of one or more convolutional layers followed by fully connected layers. Techniques like dropout and batch normalization may be used to improve model performance and prevent overfitting.
